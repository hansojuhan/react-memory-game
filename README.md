## Memory Game (React)

- Shows 12 cards and you have to click on them, but not 2 times in a row.

- Fetches new cat gifs every time (theoretically. In real life, after a while gets a 429 too many requests error and breaks)

- Uses a global state and app reducer to save information on cards, score, best score.
